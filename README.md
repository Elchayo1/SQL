# Welcome to my SQL portfolio!

I started my Data Analytics career by teaching myself SQL and Tableau online. I have taken multiple courses and have gained years of experience through consistency and hard work. I keep furthering my learning and understanding of Data and SQL by picking up projects from online services and by providing Data Analytics services to colleague and friends that have their own business. I also use my Graphic Design experience help businesses visualize their Data by Transforming results into visual equivalents with Tableau and/or Adobe Programs.

This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions: Jeff.krosam@Gmail.com
